# Questions
 
 - I have added some unit tests to the codebase, if i had a bit more time i would increase the coverage add some test to the second module as well
 - I have used userDefaults to store the information on liked characters, this solution is ok for a small app like this but if we were to make this in to a bigger product some different type of persistence would be needed. Maybe core data if we really need it to be stored locally if not this data should be sent to backend.
 - I have used a simple but nice looking navigation coordinator, i have based this implementation on some resources i found online. It works nice for this app but im not sure if this is the most scalable and maintainable solution. To be able to answer that i would need a bit more time to do some research and explore options. For this project solution i used seems fine its testable easy to understand and is extendable.
